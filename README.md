## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Throughout the duration of this project, I have acquired a wealth of knowledge and skills. Notably, I have expanded my expertise in CSS by mastering several new properties, enabling me to craft a responsive navbar that seamlessly adapts to diverse screen sizes, including the creation of a mobile-friendly hamburger menu. Furthermore, I have leveraged the SwiperJS library to design an intuitive slider for the crew page, facilitating effortless navigation through crew members via keyboard, pagination dots, or touch functionality on mobile devices.

### Continued development

Looking ahead, I am committed to further advancing my expertise in CSS. Moreover, I intend to augment my proficiency in React by exploring cutting-edge techniques in state management and component composition, ultimately elevating my ability to craft sophisticated, scalable, and maintainable front-end applications.
